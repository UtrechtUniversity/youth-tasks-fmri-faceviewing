# Face Viewing task for functional MRI

The face viewing task is aimed at activating face processing areas in the brain. Participants are required to passively view pictures of faces (happy, fearful, or neutral expression) and pictures of houses. The pictures are presented in a pseudorandom order with blocks of face images interspersed with blocks of house images. The stimuli are taken from the Radboud Faces Database (Langner et al., 2010). Stimuli are presented in blocks of 18â€¯s, with four blocks for each of the four stimulus types. Rest periods are modeled as implicit baseline. Because of the short duration of the task, this block-design combined with passive viewing was chosen to ensure a strong contrast between conditions, without noise from behavioral responses. Behavioral data on emotion recognition in the children is measured in another part of YOUth (outside the scanner) during a computer task. To ensure that participants stay awake, they are instructed to press a button in between the block in response to a cue (red circle).
